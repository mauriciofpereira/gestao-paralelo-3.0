This is the frontend part of the My Web System project, built with React and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

## Project Structure

The frontend project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains all the source code for the application.
  - `App.tsx`: The main component that sets up routing and layout.
  - `index.tsx`: The entry point of the React application.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable components.
  - `pages/`: Contains page components for different routes.
  - `types/`: Contains TypeScript interfaces for type safety.

## Built With
